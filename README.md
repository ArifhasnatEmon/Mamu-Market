# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Website

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a responsive multi-vendor e-commerce website that allows multiple sellers to display and sell their products on a single platform. Customers can browse products from different vendors, place orders, and make secure payments through the system.

The website will be designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience across all devices, including mobile phones and desktop computers. The platform will also include vendor management, order tracking, and basic admin control to ensure efficient operation.
